# Summary

We present the Rust library hdt-rs (named "hdt" in the context of Rust libraries, such as [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hdt)) for the Header Data Triples (HDT) binary RDF compression format described by @hdt2012 and @hdt2013.
This allows writing high-performance Rust applications that load and query HDT files using triple patterns.
Existing Rust applications using the Sophia [@sophia] library can easily and drastically reduce their RAM usage by using the provided Sophia HDT adapter.

# Statement of need

Semantic Web technologies have seen adoption by major tech companies in recent years
but widespread use is still inhibited by a lack of freely available performant, accessible, robust and adaptable tooling [@semanticwebreview].
SPARQL endpoints provide a standard publication channel and API to any RDF graph but they are not suitable for all use cases.
On small knowledge bases, there is a large relative overhead in both memory and CPU resources.
On large knowledge bases on the other hand, query complexity and shared access may cause an overload of the server, causing delayed or missed responses.
Longterm availability of SPARQL endpoints is often compromised [@readyforaction], which impacts all applications depending on them.

To insulate against such problems, Semantic Web applications may integrate and query an RDF graph using libraries such as Apache Jena [@jena] for Java,
RDFlib [@rdflib] for Python, librdf [@librdf] for C or Sophia [@sophia] for Rust.
However those libraries do not scale to large RDF graphs due to their excessive memory usage, see \autoref{fig:benchmark},
which can be drastically lowered by using the Header Data Triples (HDT) binary RDF format, which can be loaded into memory in compressed form while still allowing efficient queries.
Implementations existed for C++ [@hdtcpp] and Java [@hdtjava] but not for Rust, a popular modern, statically typed high-level programming language that allows writing performant software while still ensuring memory safety,
which aligns with the challenges to the adoption of the Semantic Web.
The Rust HDT library is used through the included Sophia adapter by the RickView [@rickview] RDF browser to publish large knowledge bases, for example LinkedSpending [@linkedspending] at <https://linkedspending.aksw.org>,
which previously suffered from frequent downtimes when based on a SPARQL endpoint.

![Dataset loading time, memory usage (resident set size) and ?PO triple pattern query time of different RDF libraries on an Intel i9-12900k CPU based on the benchmark suite of @sophia.
librdf was not benchmarked on $10^6$ triples and beyond due to graph loading exceeding several hours.
hdt-java produces `DelayedString` instances, which are converted to strings to account for the time that would otherwise be spent later.
The index files that hdt-java and hdt-cpp produce are deleted before each run.
Versions: Apache Jena 4.6.1, n3.js 1.6.3, librdf 1.0.17, RDFlib 6.2.0, sophia 0.8.0-alpha, hdt-rs 0.0.13-alpha, hdt-java 3.0.9, hdt-cpp master fbcb31a, OpenJDK 19, Node.js 16.18.0, clang 14.0.6, Python 3.10.8, rustc 1.69.0-nightly (target-cpu=native), GCC 12.2.1.

# Limitations
* describe hdt standard format
Extensions such as HDT++ [@serializingrdf] or iHDT++ [@ihdt] are currently not supported.-->

We thank Pierre-Antoine Champin for explaining the details of Sophia and for creating [the benchmark suite](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_benchmark) 
that the [HDT benchmarks](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/hdt_benchmark) are based on.
