A Rust library for the [Header Dictionary Triples](https://www.rdfhdt.org/) compressed RDF format, including:

* loading the HDT default format as created by [hdt-cpp](https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-cpp)
* converting N-Triples to HDT
* efficient querying by triple patterns
* serializing into other formats like RDF Turtle and N-Triples using the [Sophia](https://crates.io/crates/sophia) adapter
* running SPARQL queries (with the experimental "sparql" feature but HDT is not optimized for that)

However it cannot:

* load other HDT variants
* swap data to disk
* modify the RDF graph in memory

If you need any of the those features, consider using a SPARQL endpoint instead.
For acknowledgement of all the original authors, please look at the reference implementations in C++ and Java by the [https://github.com/rdfhdt](https://github.com/rdfhdt) organisation.

## Examples

```rust,no_run
use hdt::Hdt;

let file = std::fs::File::open("example.hdt").expect("error opening file");
let hdt = Hdt::read(std::io::BufReader::new(file)).expect("error loading HDT");
// query
let majors = hdt.triples_with_pattern(Some("http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig"), Some("http://dbpedia.org/ontology/major"),None);
println!("{:?}", majors.collect::<Vec<_>>());
```

You can also use the Sophia graph trait implementation to load HDT files and reduce memory consumption of an existing application based on Sophia, which is re-exported as `hdt::sophia`:

```rust,no_run
use hdt::Hdt;
use hdt::sophia::api::graph::Graph;
use hdt::sophia::api::term::{IriRef, SimpleTerm, matcher::Any};

let file = std::fs::File::open("dbpedia.hdt").expect("error opening file");
let hdt = Hdt::read(std::io::BufReader::new(file)).expect("error loading HDT");
let s = SimpleTerm::Iri(IriRef::new_unchecked("http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig".into()));
let p = SimpleTerm::Iri(IriRef::new_unchecked("http://dbpedia.org/ontology/major".into()));
let majors = hdt.triples_matching(Some(s),Some(p),Any);
```

If you don't want to pull in the Sophia dependency, you can exclude it:

```toml
[dependencies]
hdt = { version = "...", default-features = false }
```

There is also a [folder with runnable examples](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/hdt/tree/main/examples), which you can run with `cargo run --example examplename` (e.g. `--example query`).

## Experimental Features
All features other than "sophia" are experimental and are neither guaranteed to work in all combinations nor adher to semver: they may change or be removed in future versions including minor or patch releases.

### Cache

If the experimental `cache` feature is enabled, the library will speed up repeated loading of the same file by utilizing a custom cached index file if it exists or create one if it does not exist.
Theses index files are incompatible with those generated by the C++ and Java implementations.

```rust
let hdt = hdt::Hdt::new_from_path(std::path::Path::new("tests/resources/snikmeta.hdt")).expect("snikmeta.hdt not found");
```

### SPARQL

The `sparql` feature implements [spareval](https://crates.io/crates/spareval) .

## API Documentation

See [docs.rs/latest/hdt](https://docs.rs/hdt) or generate for yourself with `cargo doc --no-deps` without disabling default features.

## Performance
The performance of a query depends on the size of the graph, the type of triple pattern and the size of the result set.
When using large HDT files, make sure to enable the release profile, such as through `cargo build --release`, as this can be much faster than using the dev profile.

### Profiling
If you want to optimize the code, you can use a profiler.
The provided test data is very small in order to keep the size of the crate down; locally modifying the tests to use a large HDT file returns more meaningful results.

#### Example with perf and Firefox Profiler

```sh
$ cargo test --release
[...]
Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/release/deps/hdt-2b2f139dafe69681)
[...]
$ perf record --call-graph=dwarf target/release/deps/hdt-2b2f139dafe69681 hdt::tests::triples
$ perf script > /tmp/test.perf
```

Then go to <https://profiler.firefox.com/> and open `/tmp/test.perf`.

## Criterion benchmark

```sh
$ cargo bench --bench criterion
```

* requires [persondata\_en.hdt](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/hdt/releases/download/benchmarkdata/persondata_en.hdt.bz2) placed in `tests/resources`

## iai benchmark

```sh
cargo bench --bench iai
```

* requires [persondata\_en\_10k.hdt](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/hdt/releases/download/benchmarkdata/persondata_en_10k.hdt.bz2) placed in `tests/resources`
* requires [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to be installed
* may require a conservative target CPU like `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=x86-64" cargo bench --bench iai`

## Comparative benchmark suite

[The separate benchmark suite](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/hdt_benchmark/blob/master/benchmark_results.ipynb) compares the performance of this and some other RDF libraries.

### Contribute
We are happy to receive pull requests.
Please use `cargo fmt` before committing, make sure that `cargo test` succeeds and that the code compiles on the stable and nightly toolchain both with and without the "sophia" feature active.
`cargo clippy` should not report any warnings.
