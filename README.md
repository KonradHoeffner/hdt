# HDT Rust

Rust implementation for the HDT library, [https://www.rdfhdt.org/](https://www.rdfhdt.org/).
The library can read out triples, but it's super slow and there's a bug here and there. I do not
really recommend using it right now. Implementing this correctly is not exactly easy because the
specification and other implementatios are sometimes conflicting.
